# Bose-UI
A collection of often-used UI elements such as buttons, etc. Hopefully will create a private cocoapod repo for this stuff.

### Bose Buttons

#### Types:
- Dark
- Light
- Primary
- PrimaryDestructive
- Secondary
- SecondaryDestructive
- Facebook
- Amazon

### Screen Brightness / Theme Switching
There is currently a reading of screen brightness and a notification if it changes. If it changes while the application is active, it can be assumed to be a dynamic change based on the screen dimming while the user is in a dark environment. Thus we can dynamically change the theme based on this reading. ThemeManager support to come soon.
